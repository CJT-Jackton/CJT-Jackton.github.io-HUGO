So I finally made up my mind to spent a weekend setting up my blog with Hugo. Well I been wanting to do this for a long time but honestly I am terrible at writing stuffs since school days. And to be fair I don't really have that much of stuffs that worth sharing. However, things are changing. As my knowledge on game developing grow I feel increasingly need to actually writing down the key points in game development. That's why I decided to started this blog.

This site is a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with this amazing [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/) made by [Luiz F. A. de Prá](https://luizdepra.com/), along with the [Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) javascript made by [Vincent Garreau](https://vincentgarreau.com/). In case you don't know yet, Hugo is a free open source website framework, and it is perfect for the website that mainly contains static content just like blog. It just simply loads way more faster. And because it will generate a whole static website for you, you can deploy your site on essentially anywhere. In my case, I host my site on Github, which is totally free for me to use. Further, Hugo has tons of amazing themes that free to use and I definitely recommand you to check them out. But I still want my blog stands out a little bit. Fortunately for me, I came across a fantastic javascript template call Particles.js and more importantly, it comes with a interactive web demo that allow me tweake the parameters of the animations to get what I like. At the end, I am very happy with its looks now.

While go with Hugo has many benefits, it does not come with no price. One major part missing in Hugo is the comments. Okay you CAN use Disqus to host your site's comments but I am inclined to rule it out of my site regarding to the privacy concern arround it in recent years. I still have not make up my mind whether looking for an alternative for Disqus or just straight up disable comment over all posts. I probably going to make some experiment on [utterances](https://utteranc.es/), let's see how it goes.
